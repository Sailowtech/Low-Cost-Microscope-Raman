### Sailowtech Open-Raman project

Welcome on the repository of the Sailowtech Open-Raman project, a low-cost and open-source Raman microscope.

## Why does this project exist ?

The aim of this project is to create a Raman microscope that could be taken on a boat for scientific expeditions, specially to analyze microplastics in the ocean. Up to now, vrey few articles describe projects of low-cost Raman microscopes (Jitao Lu, Qingsheng Xue, Haoxuan Bai, and Nan Wang, "Design of a confocal micro-Raman spectroscopy system and research on microplastics detection," Appl. Opt. 60, 8375-8383 (2021) and Aydogan, O., & Tasal, E. (2018). Designing and building a 3D printed low cost modular Raman spectrometer.
